# Performance-Optimized Dashboard App

This is a performance-optimized dashboard app built using React and MUI 5.0. The app is designed to handle a large number of creators and messages efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Features

- Display a list of creators with their relevant information
- Filter creators based on different criteria
- View detailed information about each creator
- Send messages to creators
- Real-time updates for new messages

## Technologies Used

- React
- MUI 5.0
- TypeScript
- create-react-app

## Folder Structure

The project follows the standard folder structure of a create-react-app project:

- `src/components`: Contains all the reusable components used in the app.
- `src/services`: Contains the API service for fetching data from the server.
- `src/utils`: Contains utility functions for performance optimization.

## Performance Optimization

To optimize the performance and scalability of the app, the following techniques have been implemented:

1. Virtualization: The list of creators is rendered using virtualization techniques to efficiently handle a large number of items without impacting performance.
2. Memoization: React's memoization techniques are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
3. Debouncing: Input fields and search filters are debounced to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
4. Code Splitting: The app is divided into smaller chunks using code splitting to load only the required components and reduce the initial load time.
5. Caching: API responses are cached to minimize network requests and improve response times.

## Testing

The app includes unit tests for the components and services. To run the tests, use the following command:


npm test


## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any hosting platform that supports static websites. To build the app for production, use the following command:


npm run build


This will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to a server.

## Conclusion

The performance-optimized dashboard app provides a scalable solution for handling a large number of creators and messages. With its efficient rendering techniques and performance optimizations, it ensures a smooth user experience even with a high volume of data.
